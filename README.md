# To-do-List
The following repository is my first react project. The project is  a TodoList 

The project contains Two assets. Main.jsx and App.jsx.
Main.jsx is where react renders and creates the root element and is the main component.
App.jsx is where the TodoList is developed.
App.jsx exports the function APP(). The App functionnis where the to do list items is  handled.
